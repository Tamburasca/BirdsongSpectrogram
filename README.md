# BIRDSONG SPECTROGRAM

First attempts to perform a Birdsong Spectrogram with Python utilizing MATPLOTLIB. Its relatively fast updates are achieved through blitting. However, due to the amount of data to be displayed it is relatively slow (about 5 fps).
All that's required is a quality inboard-microphone configured to at least 44100 samples/second.

On UNIX OS please consider to run the package with sudo rights:
sudo python3 -m BirdsongSpectrogram

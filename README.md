# BIRDSONG SPECTROGRAM

First attempts to perform a Birdsong Spectrogram with Python utilizing MATPLOTLIB. Its relatively fast updates are achieved through blitting. However, owing to the amount of data it is relatively slow (about 5 fps)

Anybody is welcome for revisions and suggestions.

On UNIX environments, please consider to run the package with sudo rights:
sudo python3 -m BirdsongSpectrogram

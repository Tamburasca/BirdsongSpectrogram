# BIRDSONG SPECTROGRAM

First attempts to perform a Birdsong Spectrogram with Python utilizing MATPLOTLIB. Its fast updates are achieved through blitting. However, owing to the amount of data it is relatively slow (about 5 fps)

Anybody is welcome for revisions and suggestions.

I still need to modify this repository accordingly.

Cheerio, Ralf A.
